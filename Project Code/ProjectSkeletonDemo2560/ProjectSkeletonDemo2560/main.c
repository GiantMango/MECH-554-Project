// Open up the document in START -> WinAVR -> AVR LibC -> User Manual -> avr/interrupt.h
// Chapter 15, in Full Manual... THIS HAS A LOT OF IMPORTANT INFO...I have mentioned this at least 3 times!!!

// For those that are still having major problems, I've seen about 1/3 of the class with major problems in
// code structure. If you are still having major problems with your code, it's time to do a VERY quick overhaul.
// I've provided a skeleton structure with an example using two input capture interrupts on PORTDA0 and A3
// Please try this in the debugger.

// Create a watch variable on STATE. To do this right click on the variable STATE and then
// Add Watch 'STATE'. You can see how the variable changes as you click on PINDA0 or PINDA3. Note that the interrupt
// catches a rising edge. You modify this to suit your needs.

// If an unexpected interrupt occurs (interrupt is enabled and no handler is installed,

// The latter must be used inside assembly code in case <avr/interrupt.h> is not included.
